Aero:
Air pollution app built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Node
Pulls from Open Weather API. Will eventually have map funcitonality (with coord)

Notes:
CTRL + ALT + A to toggle Tawilwind Code readability


1. Setup    
  - ~~Setup and learn Next.js~~
  - ~~Learn server components~~
  - ~~API fetch testing for proof-of-concept~~
  - ~~Create repo~~
  - Add TypeScript into project and refactor accordingly

2. Air Data Component
  - ~~Fetch with OpenWeather air pollution API (start with one number)~~
  - ~~Build out Navbar component~~
  - ~~Style Navbar~~
  - ~~Air menu icon~~
  - ~~Make burger menu hide when it hits certain breakpoint~~
  - ~~Conditionals to render a range of 'poor' to 'good. And final number~~
  - ~~Credit Karma style UI (react-gauge-chart)~~
  - ~~value={} to be linked/referenced with whatever the index value will be.~~
  - Design the component
    - SpaceX font?
    - Container div for co, no, etc
  - Location input functionality (coord input?, then location with geocoding API)
    - Add the search bar input
    - Implement the geocoding API
    - Make the search function with the AirData component
    - Then link / reference to the map. So on search, set map change and dWata change

3. Map Integration
  - ~~Implement Leaflet to be a full screen map~~
  - Link the coorodinates with the API data
  - Adjust map controls and functionality



4. Data Visualization
Other notes:
  - Search functionality will come when map is in the picture
  - Mobile: menu on left and search in middle. Ease in from bottom for info. App inspired
  - Load spinner!
